        <div class="subheading mb-5">Political Scienceüìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Essentially I have been in school most of my life so that would be right around 14 years of educational experience right there. I have a 3.54 lifetime GPA not particularly fantastic but it is what it is. I have never been the best student but being studious is not where it matters here.  What matters is my work experience, that of which I have had plenty of experience with. For over 2 years I was a research leader at a smart watch/ tech wearable company called Tofasco, more specifically a trend asset manager. Meaning I was to search for various trends in many industries and write reports to the higher ups and discuss with them who to collaborate with and potentially ‚Äúknock off‚Äù with their products. I was in that position for two years before I resigned. I loved that job and made friendships with the people I worked with. I was considered a leader in the workplace as I led a team that collaborated with marketing as well as various other aspects of the business such as shipping. Additionally one of my greatest talents is the ability to bring people together in a collaborative way and to help them work together towards a common goal. I‚Äôve grown up in a house with entrepreneurial parents, who have worked with innovators, technologists, and creative leaders, many of whom congregated at our dinner table and who I have had the privilege of learning from. There has always been an abundance of conversation centered around team-building, problem-solving, building a strong community of people to help solve problems, and the importance of enjoying yourself along the way. Eventually, these conversations sparked my interest to get involved, to learn and, impacted the way I view my life and how friendships manifest. Throughout my 17 years of life, I‚Äôve learned that leadership is a talent and a skill. Not only is leadership shared through consistent communication and action, but more importantly the skill demonstrated through unspoken action. As the Captain of Truckee High‚Äôs boys‚Äô tennis team, I helped create a common goal and objective for the team, celebrating that we all pulled from different life experiences, biases, skill sets, and mental strengths. This openness and acceptance were how we grew together as a team. Our coach was instrumental in supporting the use of clear thoughtful communication and we created a strong support base from our peers and our girls‚Äô team. This approach was the difference between success and failure as a competitive unit. By mentoring future team leaders through my actions, on-court coaching during practice, and team workouts, it was gratifying to help mold the next generation of tennis players for Truckee High. Not only were new leaders formed during my time, but new friendships and relationships were forged. Even though we weren‚Äôt State champions, the time I had being a leader and Captain of this team was an experience I will never forget. Additionally, I worked as a tennis coach for two years at the Tahoe Donner Tennis Center in Truckee California. I was put in charge of court assignments for my peers and essentially served under my manager as an administrator of sorts.
